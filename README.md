### 1. Clone/Download the repository

Clone or Download as ZIP this repository to your PC.

### 2. Install PHP/SQL/Composer

Make sure to install:

1. [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads.php)
2. SQL Database, for instance, [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).
3. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) for managing PHP dependencies.

### 3. Configure SSL Certificate for API Requests

The application makes API calls that require SSL verification. Follow these steps to ensure API requests work correctly:

#### Download the certificate bundle
1. Download the latest CA certificate bundle from: https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem
2. Save it to a location on your system (e.g. ```C:/php/extras/ssl/cacert.pem``` or in your PHP installation directory)
3. Edit your `php.ini` file and add these lines: ```curl.cainfo = "PATH_TO_FILE/cacert.pem"``` Replace `PATH_TO_FILE` with the actual path where you saved the file.
4. Restart your web server if it's already running

### 4. Create the Database

Create an account for your MySQL DB and CREATE DATABASE vinylopiaDB.
```bash
create database vinylopiaDB
```

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

#### 5.1. Database Configuration

Create and edit a ```.env``` file according to your DB and Spotify API settings.
You can take the code from ```.env.example``` file.
After creating ```.env``` file, replace DB information with yours. For example:
```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=vinylopiaDB
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=1234
```

#### 5.2. Spotify API Configuration

To integrate with the Spotify API, you'll need to create a Spotify Developer account and register your application to get your Client ID and Client Secret. Here is how you do it:
1. Create a Spotify Developer Account
   - Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).
   - Log in with your existing Spotify account or register a new account, if you don't have one.
   - After logging in, you will be redirected to Spotify Developer Dashboard.

2. Create a New Application.
   - On the Developer Dashboard, click on the "Create App" button.
   - A form will appear where you need to provide the following details:
     1) App name;
     2) App Description;
     3) Website (optional);
     4) Redirect URI (for example: http://127.0.0.1:8000/);
     5) In a section "Which API/SDKs are you planning to use?" click on "Web API".
   - After filling out the details, click "Save" button to create the application.

3. Obtain Your Client ID and Client Secret.
   - After creating the application, you will be redirected to the application page where you need to click on "Settings" button.
   - On the settings page you will see your "Client ID" and "View client secret" button, which opens "Client secret".

4. Add the following lines to your `.env` file, replacing the placeholders with your actual **Spotify Client credentials**. 
```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="your_id"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="your_secret"
```

### 6. Install the Necessary Dependencies

Enter this command to install all necessary dependencies:
```bash
composer install
```

### 7. Create Storage Link

To create a symbolic link from ```public/storage``` to ```storage/app/public```, where user avatar images (and other files) will be stored, run the following command:
```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

### 8. Create the avatars Folder

After creating the storage link, you may need to create the ```avatars``` folder inside ```public/storage``` and ```storage/app/public``` directories if it doesn't exist.   

Correct paths should look as follows: ```public/storage/avatars``` and ```storage/app/public/avatars```

### 9. Generate Application Key

Laravel requires an application key to be set. You can generate it by running:
```bash
php artisan key:generate
```
### 10. Migrate the Database

After configuring the ```.env``` file, run the following commands to create the necessary tables in your database and populate them with vinyl information:
```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan migrate --seed
```

### 11. Serve the Application

Start the PHP server by running:
```bash
php artisan serve
```
This command will launch the server at ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/``` by default.
